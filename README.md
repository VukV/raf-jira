# Jira App

Android project for Mobile App Development course at Faculty of Computing.

The goal of the project was to learn and understand basics of Android development such as Activites and Fragments and their lifecycles, ViewModel and LiveData, data persistence using SharedPreferences, data display using RecyclerView...

The idea of the application is to be a simple task tracker for developers, where they can monitor their bugs and enhancements.
